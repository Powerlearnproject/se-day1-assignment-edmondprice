#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineerimg is a branch of computer science focused on designing, developing, testing and maintaining software
Reliability: Software engineering ensures that software works as expected, which is crucial for critical industries like healthcare, where failures can be have serious consequences.
Efficiency: It optimizes the developer workflow, helping teams create software faster without compromising on quality.
Scalability and Flexibility: It ensures that software can handle increased user demand or evolving requirements without affecting performance.
Security: Software engineers implement security measures like encryption, authentication, and authorization to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The Birth of Software Engineering (1960s):
Software engineering became a distinct field during the 1960s. As computers grew more complex, the need for better approaches to software development became apparent. Early software development was ad-hoc, leading to unreliable and hard-to-maintain programs.
The rise of structured programming:
This period saw the rise of structured programming, which emphasized clear, organized code. Techniques like modular programming, where programs are broken into smaller, manageable pieces, made software easier to develop, test, and maintain. This was the foundation of modern software engineering practices.
The Agile Revolution:
Agile methodologies, introduced in the early 2000s, transformed software development by focusing on iterative development, continuous feedback, and collaboration between teams and clients. Agile practices, such as Scrum and Kanban, have become the standard in many software development environments, making development faster and more adaptive.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process used to design, develop, and maintain software efficiently. It consists of several phases, each with a specific purpose. SDLC phases:
Planning – This phase involves defining the project scope, objectives, feasibility analysis, and resource allocation. It ensures that the development process is well-organized and aligns with business goals.
Requirements Analysis – Developers and stakeholders gather and document functional and non-functional requirements. This phase helps in understanding what the software should do and lays the foundation for design.
Design – The system architecture, user interface, database structures, and system components are designed based on the requirements. This phase includes high-level design (HLD) and low-level design (LLD) to guide development.
Coding– Developers write the actual code based on the design specifications. This phase involves programming, integrating different modules, and following best coding practices.
Testing – The software is tested for defects, security vulnerabilities, and performance issues. Testing types include unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT) to ensure reliability and functionality.
Deployment – The tested software is deployed in a live production environment. It may be released in phases or all at once, depending on the project strategy.
Maintenance – After deployment, ongoing support is provided to fix bugs, improve performance, and update the software as needed to meet evolving requirements.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall – When to Use
Projects with Fixed Requirements – Example: Developing software for airplane control systems or medical devices, where requirements are well-defined and must be followed strictly for safety.
Government & Regulatory Projects – Example: Tax calculation software where compliance with laws is required, and changes are minimal.
Construction or Manufacturing Software – Example: Blueprint design software where each phase must be completed before moving to the next.
Agile – When to Use
Dynamic and Fast-Changing Projects – Example: Mobile app development, where customer feedback and market trends frequently change.
Startups and Minimum Viable Products – Example: A new e-commerce platform where features can evolve based on user behavior and feedback.
Continuous Development and Improvement – Example: Cloud-based SaaS applications (e.g., CRM software) that require frequent updates and enhancements.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining inputs (prompts) to effectively communicate with AI models, such as ChatGPT, to achieve desired outputs. It involves structuring queries, using specific keywords, and experimenting with formats to guide the AI’s response.
Importance of Prompt Engineering in AI Interaction
 Enhances Response Accuracy
  Well-crafted prompts reduce ambiguity and help AI generate precise and relevant answers.
  Example: Instead of asking "Tell me about history," a better prompt is "Summarize key events of World War II in 200 
  words."
  Optimizes AI for Specific Tasks
   Prompt engineering tailors AI outputs for creative writing, coding, summarization, translation, and more.
  Example: A coder can use "Generate Python code for sorting a list using QuickSort."
 Improves Efficiency and Productivity
Saves time by reducing trial and error in AI interactions.
Helps automate workflows in customer support, research, and content creation.
Enables Better AI Understanding and Control
 AI models lack true understanding, so the way prompts are structured affects results.
 Example: Adding context and constraints like "Write a formal email requesting a meeting with a CEO in a polite and 
 professional tone."
Boosts AI Creativity and Problem-Solving
 Effective prompts can enhance AI’s creative capabilities for storytelling, brainstorming, and design.
 Example: "Invent a futuristic gadget that could revolutionize transportation."

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Example"Tell me about technology."
Improved Prompt:
 "Summarize the impact of artificial intelligence on the healthcare industry, including examples of AI-driven medical advancements."
Why is the Improved Prompt More Effective?
Clearer Scope – Instead of the broad term "technology," the prompt focuses on artificial intelligence in healthcare.
Specificity – It requests details on AI-driven medical advancements, preventing generic responses.
Concise & Direct – The prompt clearly states what is required, making it easier for AI to generate relevant and structured content.
